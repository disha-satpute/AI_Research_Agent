## 🧩 Problem Statement

Students and researchers often struggle to:

- Find relevant and high-quality academic resources  
- Understand complex papers quickly  
- Summarize large volumes of research  
- Organize knowledge systematically

This leads to time-consuming, inefficient research efforts.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An **AI Research Agent** that:

- Retrieves relevant papers from uploaded academic content  
- Summarizes key points using LLMs  
- Answers research-related questions using grounded context from sources  
- Suggests related work, methodologies, and literature gaps

Using **IBM watsonx.ai** and **RAG**, the system provides **document-grounded** and **natural-language responses**, improving research productivity.
